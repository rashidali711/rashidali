"""
This file can be called from terminal to convert an .py file to .pyd or .c file, where .pyd is kind
of a .dll file for python which can be called in any python model but anyone can not read it easily
and .c file contains our algorithm in ``c`` programing language.
we can call the file in the following way from the terminal:

```
$ python encrypt.py -f FILE.py
```

This command line will create following 3 files and 1 folder:

- FILE.cp[PYTHON_VERSION].[OS_NAME].pyd : Files can be used as python .dll file
- FILE.c    : File contains algorithm in ``c`` programing language
- FILE.pyx  : File which is used for creating .pyd file (can delete this file)
- build (folder)    : Folder contains our algorithms .exe, .lib and .obj file

Now you can directly use .pyd file in your other python files by importing in the following way:
```
import FILE
```
